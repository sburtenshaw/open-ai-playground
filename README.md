## Initial setup - 10th July 17:23

Bootstrapped the project with `create-t3-app`.

While I don't plan on using them all initially, I enabled all the package options for convinience, incase I want to use them further down the line. The packages in question are `nextAuth.js` and `prisma`. I don't plan on integrating user authentication or implementing any features that require database storage initially. However I do have feature ideas that would require use of these concepts but are out of scope for this first version, such as:
- Chat history
- Saved presets
- Real time collaboration

I will be making use of a simple backend with tRPC early on to communicate with OpenAI's API. I'm doing this to avoid exposing my OpenAI API key in the client.

I was torn between commenting out / removing the `nextAuth` and `prisma` configurations given they are not currently being used. I decided to keep them configured to make things easier when I want to use them and to save time now. I believe the additional unnecessary footprint is not a big issue given they will likely be used in the future anyway.

Next I will be working on what I call the "Base concept". Basically a simplified version of OpenAI's Playground feature, without any advanced features or custom ideas implemented. This will be the basis to add more custom functionality to.
